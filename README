Picasa JSON Feed Parser (PJFP) was developed to capture the RSS feed from Picasa in JSON. It currently parses images and captions from the specified Picasa galleries. It also currently spits out images inside of div tags since the intended purpose of this script is to be used in conjunction with an image slideshow/gallery of some sort.

config.inc IS REQUIRED by pjfp.inc
Be sure to have it available or this system will not function!

Adding 

<FilesMatch "\.inc$">
	Order allow,deny
	Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

to your .htaccess file is recommended if you use .inc for PHP includes.
If a .inc file is requested, all of the code will be revealed as plain text (which is usually very undesirable).
