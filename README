Picasa JSON Feed Parser (PJFP) was developed to capture the RSS feed from Picasa in JSON. It currently parses images, image width, image height, and captions from the specified Picasa galleries. It returns a data array. What to do with that data is up to you.

If you intend to use this script, be sure to download a tagged version.  HEAD is not tested for stability!

Currently this system assumes the majority of images in an album are horizontal.

PJFP_config.php IS REQUIRED by PJFP.php
Be sure to have it available or this system will not function!  You can specify an alternate filename and/or path in the class variables.

If you prefer to use .inc instead of .php for include files,

Adding: 

<FilesMatch "\.inc$">
	Order allow,deny
	Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

to your .htaccess file is recommended.
If a .inc file is requested, all of the code will be revealed as plain text (which is usually very undesirable).
